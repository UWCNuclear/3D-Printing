**How to Install Ultimaker Cura, link/connect a 3D printer (Ultimaker 3S and Ultimaker 2 Ext +), and 3D print.**

**Step 1.** Download Ultimaker Cura from https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura and install.

**Step 2.** Connect the 3D printer to the computer and open Ultimaker Cura, click on settings, navigate to ‘Printers’ and click on ‘Add Printer’. For network printers, follow    instructions on the printer screen to generate an IP address for the printer. 

* Ultimaker S3, (UWC), click on ‘Add printer by IP address’ and enter the printer IP (consult UWC nuclear physics group for the IP).
* Ultimaker 2 Extended+, (UNIZULU), click on ‘Add a non-networked printer’ and select the printer. This step can be done with Ultimaker S3 as well.

**Step 3.**	Design or model your 3D project with any CAD software and save or export it as an object (.obj) file (a file format readable by Ultimaker Cura).

* *A free student edition of Siemens NX can be downloaded from: https://trials.sw.siemens.com/nx-student-edition*

**Step 4.** Open the obj file with the Ultimaker Cura. Setting and editing such as adhesion, support, layer thickness is done with the Cura. The model can also be rotated, moved, scaled, and mirrored (flipped). If satisfied with the settings, slice the model (converting it into a format readable by the 3D printer).

**Step 5.**	Save the model on an SD card or USB drive. To print directly from your computer, click print over network or USB after slicing.

**When printing material does not come out of the nozzle (blocked nozzle).**
